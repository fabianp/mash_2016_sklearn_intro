    "The process of constructing meaningful features from the data is unfortunately domain-specific (unless if you have millions of samples in which case you might be able to automate the process). Here are some strategies to turn unstructed data items into arrays of numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Text documents**:\tthe raw data, a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with a fixed size rather than the raw text documents with variable length. A popular strategy consists in counting the frequency of each word or pair of consecutive words in each document, which we will see in more detail in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Images**:\tRescale the picture to a fixed size and take all the raw pixels values (with or without luminosity normalization). Take some transformation of the signal (gradients in each pixel, wavelets transforms...). Compute the Euclidean, Manhattan or cosine similarities of the sample to a set reference images. The code book may have been previously extracted from the same dataset using an unsupervised learning algorithm on the raw pixel signal. Perform local feature extraction: split the picture into small regions and perform feature extraction locally in each area. Then combine all the features of the individual areas into a single array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Sounds** (or more generally waveforms like EEG): Similar strategies as for images within a 1D space instead of 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will examine techniques to feature extraction from text data. This is an important user case of feature extraction. Even if your challenge does not have any text data, in your career you will likely need to extract information from text data, so this is an important skill to acquire.\n"
